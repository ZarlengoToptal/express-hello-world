Stingers are used to reduce the appearance of fine lines and creases that have been etched into skin over time. We offer Xeomin® and Botox® to treat and prevent dynamic wrinkles.<\/p><p>Beneath every wrinkle is a muscle nerve. We inject micro-doses of neuromodulator into the end of that nerve to temporarily block – or freeze – its impulses and allow the facial muscles to relax. By relaxing specific muscles, we prevent the formation of permanent lines that slowly manifest over time as a result of skin tissue breakdown caused by repeated muscle contractions.<\/p>","tab_subheader2":"WHAT TO BOOK","tab_description2":"<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Complimentary Consult<br\/><\/span>If you've never had a wrinkle-relaxer treatment at Fig (or elsewhere).

It’s fantastic for all-around skin health and delivering energy into the skin’s cells to boost collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. <\/p><p>Studies show that when exposed to different wavelengths of light, skin cells grow 150–200% faster. When the light penetrates down to the target cells, a change is caused within the cell which strengthens blood capillaries, leading to improved oxygenation and detoxification of the skin. With this treatment, you can expect reduced fine lines and wrinkles, collagen and elastin boost, improved texture and circulation, hydration, and healing.

sterilized needle. <\/p><p>An IV is the fastest way to deliver nutrients and fluids throughout the body. Many essential vitamins and nutrients are water-soluble, meaning they’re not efficiently processed when you eat them. With IV therapy, your body gets exactly what it needs — and flushes out anything it doesn’t. <\/p><p>Designed for overall health maintenance, our IV solution includes vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, and vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12. Your therapy can be customized based on your goals and current or past health concerns by adding boosters such as glycine, proline, selenium, or zinc.<\/p><p>Using IV tubing and a small catheter (which helps avoid air bubbles), the contents are pulled down by gravity and flow smoothly into your bloodstream.<\/p>","tab_subheader2":"Treatment Details","tab_description2":"<p>Our IV drip starts with a consultation with one of our Naturopathic Doctors. There is no pain associated with treatment aside from the slight initial pinch from the sterilized needle. You’ll be asked to rest your arm on a pillow and, if needed, provided with a warming pad.<\/p><p>Relax and feel free to listen to a podcast or a meditation while reclining underneath our LED Light Therapy, which helps reduce inflammation and improves mood.<\/p><p>While our Fig Shots (vitamin injections) are administered relatively quickly, IV+LED may take a bit more time. The specific length of treatment will vary depending on the specific drip and your physiology. Your Naturopathic Doctor will monitor you discreetly.<\/p><p>Please note: In some cases, a vein may not be able to be located easily.

Other reasons for bruising include, but are not limited to: thinning skin, vasculitis, purpuric dermatosis, platelet deficiency, liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, vitamin C deficiency, moving your body during the injection, or dehydration. <\/p><p>You may experience pinpoint bleeding where the needle pierces the skin, but it will be minimal and subside within a few seconds.
