On occasion, you may experience some discomfort, bruising, redness, itching, inflammation, or tenderness at or around the site of injection that could last from a few minutes to several days. Less frequent side effects may include light headedness, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, warmth, or flushing. True allergic reaction is extremely rare. However, if you experience throat swelling, a pruritic (itchy) body rash, dangerously low blood pressure (that may result in light headedness, fainting, or feeling weak), or symptoms associated with anaphylaxis (such as throat swelling or trouble breathing) following administration of an injection, please visit your nearest emergency department without hesitation or call 9-1-1. If you know you are allergic to any of the ingredients in a Fig shot please avoid it! Discomfort or pain is more common when you are dehydrated, tense, or you’ve just worked out the muscle we injected. The key is to relax, be well-nourished, and come hydrated!<\/p>"}},"3eac693b-540d-48c9-adf2-65032e133031":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"ARE THE FIG SHOTS SAFE?
